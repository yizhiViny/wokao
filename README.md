![logo](art/CDEV-Engine-Logo.png)

This is the repository of CDEV Engine, an Friday Night Funkin' Engine.

## Build instructions

First you need to install Haxe and HaxeFlixel.
1. [Install Haxe 4.2.5](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.2.5/) (Download 4.2.5 instead of 4.1.5.)
2. [Install HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/) after downloading Haxe.

Second, you need to install the additional libraries, a fully updated list will be in `Project.xml` in the project root. Here's the list of libraries that you need to install:
```
flixel
flixel-addons
flixel-ui
hscript
newgrounds
hxCodec
extension-androidtools
```
Type `haxelib install [library]` for each of those libs, so like: `haxelib install newgrounds`.

You'll also need to install a couple things that involve Gits. To do this, you need to do a few things first.
1. Download [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Works for Windows, Mac, and Linux, just select your build.
2. Follow instructions to install the application properly.
3. Run `haxelib git polymod https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod.git` to install Polymod.
4. Run `haxelib git discord_rpc https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc` to install Discord RPC.

You should have everything ready for compiling the engine! Follow the guide below to continue!

At the moment, you can optionally fix the transition bug in songs with zoomed out cameras.
- Run `haxelib git flixel-addons https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-addons` in the terminal/command-prompt.

### Compiling game

Once you have all those installed, it's pretty easy to compile the engine. You just need to run 'lime test html5 -debug' in the root of the project to build and run the HTML5 version.

To compile the engine on your desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux), you need to install Visual Studio Community 2019.
While installing VSC, don't click on any of the options to install workloads. Instead, go to the individual components tab and choose the following:
* MSVC v143 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools
* Windows SDK (10.0.17763.0)

The executables are located on export/ folder in the root of your project after it was compiled.

Once everything has done, have fun with the engine!

## WHAT?? MESSY SOURCE CODE??
yeah uh, most of the codes there are made when i still lack of haxe understanding, i'm still cleaning it up

# Important thing
## READ THE ENGINE'S DOCUMENTATION HERE: https://core5570ryt.github.io/FNF-CDEV-Engine/
CDEV Engine is currently only supported for Windows target only since the code is messed up and more (sorry!)
